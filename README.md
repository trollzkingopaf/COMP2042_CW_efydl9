For my implementation, I used Intellij Version 2022.3 as my primary IDE for development of this project.

For my implementation, my Javadoc documents are stored in java/Javadoc subfolder. I have also writen a summary on how to obtain the Javadoc on my GitHub repository.

A few of the features I have implemented include a permanent highscore text file to store the leaderboard username and scores but sorting of arraylist, a podium view to toggle the selection of leaderboard view, a textfield to enter username to play the game, a button to exit the game application completely by closing the window container, a choice box to select the background colour of my game application a game mode selector to select the grid size for the user to play the game, an alert box prompt text to allow the user to end the game by winning or to continue playing.

A few of the features such as write read doesnt allow to loop therefore I will need to terminate the game application to show the correct leaderboard and the leaderboard score for podium view is duplicated for the first element. However such an error doesn't occur for my leaderboard username.

I have implemented all the features I can think of.

I introduced a new Main Menu Controller class and a Leaderboard Controller class so that I can add and implement interesting features to my FXML scenes.

All other classes are modified and refactored to allow better readability and understanding.
